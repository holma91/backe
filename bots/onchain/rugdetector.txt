AUTOMATIC AUDIT

check the contract deployer
    - is it a new account?
    - what is the account activity?
    - multisig account could be super bullish?
    - whitelist accounts from all succesful projects ever
    

check for scammish behaviour
    - check for dead coins
    - check for audit
    - check the top holders
    - check website and when was is created? whois.domaintools.com
    - check social media
    - token sniffer
    - 

check if the contract is verified by a block explorer
    - doesn't seem to help much against rugs

sample on 50 scams
    - 38% honeypots, not possible to sell
    - 42% ownership NOT renounced, owner can do whatever he wants
    - 28% had adequate liq, and 53 of that 28% had >95% of the liq burned or locked
    - some had buy and sell fees around 90% (effectively a honeypot)
    - 100% had verified contracts...

CHECK FOR HONEYPOT
    - write a selenium bot that checks on rugdoc, honeypot.is, tokensniffer. (not sure which site is the most reliable)
    - or can I figure out how to do it natively?

CHECK FOR CONTRACT OWNERSHIP
    - 

CHECK FOR LIQUIDITY
    - should be able to this natively
    - check percentage of the supply in the LP
    - minimum amount of the native token in the LP

CHECK FOR LOCKED LIQUIDITY
    - need 3rd party probably?

CHECK FOR BUY AND SELL FEES
    - might be available in the contract?
    - otherwise, selenium bot on tokensniffer? (not optimal)
