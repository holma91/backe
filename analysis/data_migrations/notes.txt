end - start - inflow + outflow


how do I follow addresses?

- alchemy webhooks (only works on eth)
- check every new block, if stuff happening then query etherscan to see if we have a new swap

approach 2:
1. wait for new block
2. go through all txs, finds address x
3. query etherscan for the latest ttes from x
4. if there was a swap, find it by comparing block heights
