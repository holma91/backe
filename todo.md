HIGH-LEVEL
what is the most important?

1. listen for address movements
    - can follow all movements on ethereum via alchemy
    - can follow all dex swaps on other chains by listening to the Swap event of a Pair
2. listen for new tokens
    - can follow all pair creations on every evm chain
3. listen for tweets

    -

4. set up notifications for movements that are worthy
    - email? discord? native mac notifs?

TODO:

-   go through real-time course
-   set up a connection from server to website

RETHINKING THE FRONTEND
instead of a web app, just have a discord server as the frontend (from the start)

-   group for every category of notifications
    -   channel for every chain
